Your question is not clear .Can you explain wht you want exactly.
it seems you need something like adding ancor Tag Name for example your page is very lenthy and having vertical scroll on page.
now you need to click some link and go to the Gridview position at the bottom of the page .if You are looking something like this then you can do like addint this in your top of page
"Go To My GV"
"a href=#gv"


and in bottom og page before your gv add this code.

"MY GV"

a name="gv
